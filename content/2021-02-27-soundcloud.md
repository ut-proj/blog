Well, I've started doing it: [publishing to soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/oubiwann/tracks). Mostly, this is thanks to all the wonderful support from the Erlang/BEAM community for their positive feedback on various talks and demos I've given around Extempore and undertone.

More tracks will be published in the future, as they are created.

Also, note that I'm creating musical content under the name [Forgotten Tones](https://soundcloud.com/forgotten-tones/tracks).
