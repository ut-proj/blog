In a previous post regarding the [video teaser](@/2021-01-05-teaser-video.md) for the Lambda Days 2021 conference, an ambient piece was used as the "score" for the video. It has now been published on soundcloud here:

{{ soundcloud_mini(
       track_id="968360833",
       track_name="CONIVNCTIO IOVIS ET SATVRNI",
       track_url_name="conivnctio-iovis-et-satvrni",
       user_id="forgotten-tones",
       user_name="𝚝𝚑𝚎 Forgotten Tones 𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚓𝚎𝚌𝚝",
       colour="2d6072",
       auto_play="false",
       show_comments="false",
       hide_related="true") }}

14 tracks were used to create this:

* nine tracks created with undertone (using the Extempore backend) for the bulk of the song; these were connected to various sounds in nine different instances of SynthMaster 2.9 software synths (VST plugin)
* two tracks of SynthMaster 2.9 used for intro and outro
* two tracks of Arturia's Moog modular V (Moog System 55 emulation)) for intro and outro
* one FX send with Valhalla vintage reverb

Pictured below is an image (captured by phone) of the 60" living room screen being used for final production of the song.

A fun side note is that the chords used for this song were originally taken from Paul Davids' first [Beautiful Chords video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_T-jYyQCbQ). 

Lastly, I documented some of the process from chords to song in [this ticket](https://github.com/ut-proj/undertone/issues/37).
