For a forthcoming talk I'll be giving at Lambda Days this year, I've created a teaser video:

It's my understanding that I received a invitation to speak at Lambda Days due to a well-received podcast interview on [Functional Geekery](https://www.functionalgeekery.com/episode-132-duncan-mcgreggor/). To my delight, I was told I could speak on any topic I desired, instantly I thought of undertone, even as new as it is, and began racing to get new featues implemented that would allow me to speak about the project meaninfully. 

First and foremost, undertone had to support the programmatic generation of music. To make matters more pressing, in late December, the conference organisers asked the speakers to create teaser video's for their talks. At that point, the list became:

* land new features supporting music generation
* wrote code to generate a song
* record a video
* use the new LFE-created song as a "score" for the video

On 21 December, right as the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction was occuring and all telescopes on the planet were trained on Earth's larger siblings, I finished recording an ambient track I could use for the video. Production took me far longer than I expected, I lost count of the number of takes before I had something moderately acceptable, and then post-production was a further time-wreck. 

I did finally complete the teaser late at night, after the 24th of December had turned into the 25th's wee hours.

In the end, though, I had an _enormously_ good time both creating the music and putting it to video. It has inspired me to attempt a full album of ambient music in this vein ... we shall see!
