There's a new Github org for undertone at [github.com/ut-proj](https://github.com/ut-proj). The undertone project proper is at [github.com/ut-proj/undertone](https://github.com/ut-proj/undertone).

For the curious, the timeline of causality for this project is:

* **2012-2014**: Initial experimentation with Overtone.
* **2014**:  Met Andrew Sorensen, creator of Extempore, at OSCON 2014 after his incredible live coding keynote. Chatted with other LFE developers on IRC, pondered some possible mechanisms for integrating LFE/OTP and Extempore, but nothing panned out.
* **2015-2019**: Did some more Overtone and SuperCollider experimentation. Despite multiple attempts over the years, it never really captured my full interest.
* **8 September 2020**: Aleksander Lisiecki wrote the blog post [The sound of Erlang: How to use Erlang as an instrument](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/blog/the-sound-of-erlang-how-to-use-erlang-as-an-instrument/)
* **10 September 2020** (today): I published an [LFE port](https://github.com/lfe/examples/tree/master/sound-of-lfe) of the Erlang code in that blog post, and then immediately created the undertone project, knowing how much further I want to take things :-)
