In the music theory class I'm taking, I've found that even though I was originally trained on piano and have never had any chorale training, I have a better job hearing intervals if I use a sampled choir instead of some of my favourite sampled piano sounds.

I've looked at several sampled choir VST plugins and am really lusting after the [Eric Whitacre choir by Spitfire](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/eric-whitacre-choir/). Until I can afford that, I've been using their free choir VST plugin based upon the premium one ([link](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/choir); I've also really been enjoying their pipe organ samples, too).

In fact, I was having such an incredible set of personal sound revelations with the choir plugin that I tried doing a simple arragement of Chpoin's prelude in C minor. I've uploaded the result to soundcloud:

{{ soundcloud_mini(
       track_id="1041500689",
       track_name="Chopin, Op. 28 No. 20 (C Minor) - Choir",
       track_url_name="chopin-op-28-no-20-c-minor-choir",
       user_id="oubiwann",
       user_name="Duncan McGreggor",
       colour="2d6072",
       auto_play="false",
       show_comments="false",
       hide_related="true") }}

I never imagined saying this, but I think in my future studies of counterpoint and harmony, I will be spending a great deal of time with chorale music and maybe even get some formal training on the same ...
